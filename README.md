Cryptid Keeper
https://cryptid-keeper.herokuapp.com/


A express app for hosting details of paranormal encounters/entities and commenting on them. People can create new entries and they will be displayed on approval by a user with admin permissions. Users can register and the comments will autofill their name. Otherwise it will default to anonmyous. The app has a search bar and will query by either name or tags. <br /> 
<br /> 
The app has full CRUD functionality. It was built using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and EJS.
<br /> 
<br /> 
Unsolved Problems<br /> 
Having certain elements only appear to logged on users. I spent a fair bit trying out different methods before I ditched it to focus on more important things.<br /> 




To Be Improved On or To Do<br /> 
Better CSS Styling<br /> 
Sub pages for individual posts by users that are shown on the entries page with their own discussion section.<br />
